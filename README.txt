OPENCV TRYOUT CODE REPOSITORY
@ StevenPuttemans
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

A small repository to contain some sample openCV projects that need more research
before it is even sensible to add them as pull requests to the larger database.

Feel free to fork the repository and submit changes for running code.

Discussions can be started in three ways:
- Go to http://answers.opencv.org/question/17461/help-with-clustering-algorithm-called-neuralgas/ and place it there.
- Create an issue on the active repository, and discuss problems there.
- Create a pull request on top of the repository.
